## Project Workflow

**Exceeds Expectations**

Your readme and user stories are both great! Wireframes and ERDs are good too, though
it wouldn't hurt to make them digital for better legibility. (Also, I'd delete
the readme.rdoc since it's not relevant)

For your project video, I would have liked to see a bit more code, such as your
`ability.rb` file, since that's where a lot of the interesting stuff is!

## Technical Requirements

**Exceeds Expectations**

Your app is pretty complex for a 2nd project, incorporating many models and
complex associations and authorization. Great job! The only technical aspects
I would suggest would be to look for ways to improve the UX. E.g.: when a user
signs up, they have to manually find the profile page, wouldn't it be nice
if they were redirected to create their profile automatically? You can do that
using just tools you know (before_action), or there's a way to configure devise
to do so... I'll let you look it up if you want!

## Creativity / Interface

**Meets Expectations**

The interface is certainly fine for a project 2, but it's definitely the area
where with the most room for growth. I think a bit more time spent on CSS and
layout would improve the UI quite a bit!

That said, IMO, this isn't the most important aspect of P2, so I'm not
suggesting you should have spent a lot more time here instead of working on your
backend.

## Code Quality

**Meets Expectations**

Generally, your code is very high quality, in terms of neatness, simplicity,
and readability. The only reason I didn't mark this as 'exceeds' is because
there were a lot of places where indentation should be fixed. See my inline
code comments for more!

## Deployment and Functionality

**Exceeds Expectations**

This app is very functional, and I encountered no errors while testing it! Great
job!
